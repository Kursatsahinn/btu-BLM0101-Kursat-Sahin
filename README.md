# Project Topic: Computer Architecture and Logic Gates

**Project Description:** The initial phase of this repository simulates the processing of two user-provided binary inputs (0 or 1) through a selected logic gate to determine and display the resultant output. 

# How Can You Run This Code
 **This project has two stages.**
 * ## First Stage
    * User must enter two binary inputs for logic gates (1 or 0)
    * After that user must choose a logic gate. (AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOT)
    * User will receive a result based on the logic gate they choose.
 * ## Second Stage
     * In the second stage user can see a truth table for (A and (B or C)) logic gate combination.
     * User can't choose or change the combination.
     * We uses a nested for loop to show the truth table.
